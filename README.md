# Graphing-parabola
The project consists of graphing a parabola from its general equation. In addition, its elements such as: the vertex, focus, length of a straight side and its equation in ordinary form will be shown

# Instructions for execution:
The program is made with the python language.
First, the user will be asked to choose an option 1 or 2 depending on the type of parabola equation in general form. The equation must be in the form Ay^2 + By+ Cx+D=0 (option 1), or Ax^2 + Bx+ Cy+D=0 (option 2).
Then the program will ask for the coefficients of said equation, the user must write them separating them by a space. For example, if the equation were of the form "y^2 -8y -8x +40", the user would first type "1" as an option. Then the user will write the coefficients "1 -8 -8 40".
The program will display a graph of the parabola and print data about it, such as the vertex, focus, straight side, etc.

# Introduction

The term parabola is defined as: "locus of all points in the plane that are equidistant from a fixed line called directrix and from a fixed point called focus".
During this project it is expected to graph a parabola given its equation in a general way, as well as present its elements.

# Methodology

For the beginning of the project, the general objective was established, which is to graph a parabola given its equation and present its elements.
Subsequently, work was done on the development of the code to carry out the graphing of the equation, during this journey the general equation of each parabola was studied to obtain formulas that will optimize data collection, for example the coordinates of the vertex, and generalize it. for each case depending on whether it is vertical or horizontal.
